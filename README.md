# Automated Podcast Transcription and Topic Segmentation 

## 📌 Project Statement
An AI-powered system that automatically transcribes podcast audio 
recordings and segments them into distinct topical sections. Leveraging advances in speech-to-text technology 
and natural language processing, the system will enable users to navigate podcasts efficiently by browsing 
topics and key discussion points without listening to the entire episode.
